ansible-howsmyssl
=================

Ansible role to deploy [howsmyssl](https://github.com/jmhodges/howsmyssl)


Requirements
------------

Ubuntu 14.04LTS.  Other Linux flavors may or may not work - YMMV.  


Role Variables
--------------

A description of the settable variables for this role should go here, including any variables that are in defaults/main.yml, vars/main.yml, and any variables that can/should be set via parameters to the role. Any variables that are read from other roles and/or the global scope (ie. hostvars, group vars, etc.) should be mentioned here as well.


Dependencies
------------

*none*


Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

```yaml
- hosts: howsmyssl_servers
  roles:
    - howsmyssl
```
